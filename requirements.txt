# Python version: 3.10 recommended

# Core libraries
torch>=2.0,<3.0
numpy>=1.22.2
requests>=2.32.2

# Transformers pinned for CheXagent
transformers==4.40.0

# Streamlit
streamlit>=1.43.2

# PIL (Pillow)
pillow>=10.3.0

# Qwen VLM
# We'll rely on 'transformers==4.40.0' for some of the Qwen2.5 Instruct code,
# but note that certain Qwen features might need a more recent version.
# If they fail on 4.40.0, you may have to isolate CheXagent in a separate environment.

# Dependencies for optional tasks:
# SAM2 is not on PyPI. You likely need to install it from GitHub or a local directory.
# qwen_vl_utils is presumably local or from a GitHub repo as well.

# If you want or need xformers (sometimes helpful for performance), you can install:
# xformers>=0.0.20
pyarrow>=14.0.1 # not directly required, pinned by Snyk to avoid a vulnerability
tornado>=6.5 # not directly required, pinned by Snyk to avoid a vulnerability
urllib3>=2.2.2 # not directly required, pinned by Snyk to avoid a vulnerability
validators>=0.21.0 # not directly required, pinned by Snyk to avoid a vulnerability
